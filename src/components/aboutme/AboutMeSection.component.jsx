        <p>
          I'm a web developer specialising in the MERN Stack who has a passion
          for creating clean looking websites and functional web apps to provide
          a seamless experience for the end user.

        <h4 className="color-secondary">My Goals</h4>
        <p>
          My short term goal is to learn GraphQL and build a project with the technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the future I hope to expand my skillset to mobile development and
          build applications with React Native.
